# Changelog

## [1.9.8] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `asc845-swap-reprice-skill` — ASC 845 equal-value exchange repricing for swap legs; bundled `scripts/reprice_swaps.py` and `scripts/orchestrate_reprice.py` to zero clearing account residuals via `setManualFiatValue`

## [1.9.7] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `tres-upload-tx-header-validation` skill — exact display-name header row for TRES bulk transaction CSV uploads; prevents snake_case / wrong column name rejections

## [1.9.6] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed
- **Telemetry observability:** `scripts/telemetry.py` now appends a one-line JSON outcome (`ok` / `http_error` / `transport_error` / `encode_error`) to `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/telemetry.log` on every invocation. The wrapping hook chain is fully muted (`2>/dev/null`, bare excepts, fire-and-forget background), so users previously had no way to tell whether telemetry was actually reaching the proxy. The log is size-capped at 256 KiB with one rotation.
- **MCP soft-errors no longer reported as successes:** the bff-mcp tool handlers catch their own exceptions and return error-shaped responses, which Claude Code surfaces via `PostToolUse` (success). `telemetry.py` now inspects `tool_response` and flips `success=false` when the response is shaped like an `ErrorResponse` (top-level `error`, or `status: "error"`). Previously every MCP tool call recorded `success=true`.
- **Backgrounded telemetry can no longer be reaped by Claude Code:** `track.sh` now detaches the python child via `setsid` (preferred), `nohup` (fallback), or `disown` (last resort), so the HTTP POST has time to complete even if Claude Code cleans up the hook's process group.

### Changed
- Bumped `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from `1.9.0` to `1.9.6` so marketplace installs no longer pin to a stale matcher (was the indirect cause of the regression PR #11 fixed).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Usage analytics: skill invocations and MCP tool calls are tracked via the TRES backend (forwarded to Mixpanel server-side). No financial data, GraphQL query content, or tool responses are included — only event type, tool/skill name, success flag, org identity, session ID, plugin version, and timestamp. See `docs/SECURITY-HLD.md` for the full data-flow description.
