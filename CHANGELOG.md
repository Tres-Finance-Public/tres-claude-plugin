# Changelog

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Usage analytics: skill invocations and MCP tool calls are tracked via the TRES backend (forwarded to Mixpanel server-side). No financial data, GraphQL query content, or tool responses are included — only event type, tool/skill name, success flag, org identity, session ID, plugin version, and timestamp. See `docs/SECURITY-HLD.md` for the full data-flow description.
